3. **Contextual Understanding**: Uses attention mechanisms and memory banks to maintain context.
4. **Response Generation**: Generates replies using transformer-based models trained on conversational datasets.
5. **Emotional Layering**: Applies sentiment analysis and tone modifiers to add emotional nuance.
6. **Output Delivery**: Responses are rendered in text or voice, depending on user settings.
